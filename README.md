# QuikkLyric

QuikkLyric is a web application that we can use to search song lyrics using React.js built in context API along with the Musixmatch public API.

The lyrics page gets the lyrics by making a request to the Musixmatch API.

It has the search component and the ability to dispatch an action to the reducer in our context to update the track list in the state with the search results. 

### Home Page
